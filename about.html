<h2>About Me</h2>

<h2>About this Blog</h2>
<p>Derek Sivers, formerly of CD Baby, once had a great point: it's an unfortunate reality that we lose a lot of of knowledge we gain from books a week or two after finishing it. As a result, he created a page on his blog where he provides in depth summaries of all the books he has read for the benefit of himself and others. This way the information he gained can be easily accessible in the future. See sivers.org/book <br><br> This blog follows Derek's inspiration. I'll choose to focus the topic of this blog
specifically on software development books I've read. Nuanced knowledge of this is especially important for developers because of the sheer amount of knowledge we're expected to have all the time. Please enjoy this blog as a resource for yourself and others! </p>

<h2>Current Books on this Blog</h2>

1. Sandi Metz's Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)
2. Douglas Crockford's JavaScript the Good Parts
