John Resig is best known for inventing jQuery and the website theCHIVE.com. He wrote a book called Secrets of the Javascript Ninja which is incredible. Resig provides an in-depth understanding of how Javascript operates that is crucial for any JS developer. He explains what's going on under the hood in a succint and clear way. Notably, the second edition has great explanations on ES6 features.

These upcoming series of posts give you my notes on this incredible book. Make sure to pick up a copy on Amazon!

JS Browser infrastructure: DOM, Events, Timers
-DOM: structured representation of the UI of a client-side web application
-Events: A huge majority of JS apps are event-driven applications, meaning that most of the code is executed in the context of a response to a particular event (e.g.: network events, timers, and user-generated events: licks, mouse moves, keyboard presses, etc.)
-Browser API: the browser offers an API that allows information about devices, store data locally, or communicate with remote servers.
	
Best Practices can be broken down into: debugging skills, testing, performance analysis

1. Debugging:
	-Use firebug, chrome devtools 
2. Testing
3. Performance Analysis: output the time elapsed since the timer was started.
