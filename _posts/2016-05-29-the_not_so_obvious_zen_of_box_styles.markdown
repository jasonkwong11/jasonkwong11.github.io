	Most developers understand box styles as tools to transform a barebones HTML page into a slick looking modern web application. But did you know that mastering box styles is a means to master one's life? No, really! Below are four of the many life lessons box styles can teach us. 

1. Begin with the end. Be specific in what you want. 
	
	When building that perfect webpage, envision the features it will contain before writing the code. Maybe a minimalist interface with bold typeface and warm welcoming colors is the goal. Three columns that take up a third of the page? Or one that takes up two thirds and the other, one third? Find elements of your favorite websites you find appealing and want to incorporate into your own page before you set out to write the code for it. 

	Life gives us very little guidance on how to life it. Generally we avoid breaking the law, make some money, and find someone to share a bathroom with. But beyond this, how should we live our life? Like building our perfect webpage, we must envision the features we want when we create our lives. Decide when you want to wake up in the morning. Drive to work, commute by subway, or work in your pajamas? By beginning with the end in mind and being specific in what we want from life, we then work backwards to achieve our goals. 

2. Always account for the padding.
	
	The padding is the transparent space between your content and the border in the content-padding-border-margin box model. This often forgotten space can throw off even the most meticulously calculated heights and widths. When coding your box styles, don't forget to account for the padding.

	In life, it's often these transparent spaces hidden in our blindspots that throw off our best laid plans. We often don't know what we don't know. Teachers in school ask, "Any questions?" But when we're in unfamiliar territory, how do we know what questions to ask? A great life lesson I've learned is to whatever extent possible, ask, "What don't I know about this situation?" This helps avoid surprises when we're deep into a task. Whenever you start an endeavor. Don't be a fool. Account for the padding.

3. Have a great foundation to build on. 

	Even the best box styling tricks can't cover up badly written HTML. If you have extra divs floating around, the margins are off, or the columns don't quite look proportional or scale properly your fancy white-wood texture or space background won't matter. Similarly if your HTML isn't well organized (see next section), it won't lend itself to change very easily and your dream box styles may involve more headache and rewriting than necessary. 

	The philosopher and psychologist, William James once said, "All of our life is nothing but a mass of habits." We as human beings are basically habit machines, both good and bad. So quality of life may largely be determined by one's habits. Thinking positively, taking responsibility for one's actions, and approaching setbacks as opportunities for growth are positive habits that set the foundation for a reaching goals in life. 

4. Label the different parts to keep things organized

	Label, label, label! When implementing box styles, it's important to separate the different parts of your code and to label your code by function. The logo, navigation bar, background, layout, social media bar, header, main sections are examples of different labels to use when organizing your code. This makes it easier to implement changes later if revisions are needed.

	Separating and defining different parts of your day can help you avoid burnout and balance responsibilities. For example, I like to schedule two five-hour coding sessions with a gym break in between to mentally recharge and foster creativity without interrupting flow. Afterwards I can watch basketball without feeling guilty. Strictly defining your day helps you figure what works, what doesn't and allows for measurable results. This lets you adjust how you allocate your time as you see fit.
