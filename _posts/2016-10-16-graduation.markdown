Wow, it's been a challenging six months since I started Flatiron Schools bootcamp, but what an experience! I've pushed myself further and learned more than I ever thought I could in six months. I've built and published a ruby gem. I created a blogging app to let people share the best advice they've accrued over their life. I created a search engine for real estate investors to evaluate a property. More importantly, I feel like I've developed the problem solving skills and the clarity of thought to attack any problem in life, especially in the domain of web development. 

I've figured out patterns of code design, good debugging habits, and a confidence in my ability to learn quickly. While there are great resources in the the Flatiron School course, as I got closer to the end, I realized that much of the responsibility of the work in learning is that you must seek materials out yourself. There is no better teacher than hands on practical experience in creating web apps. While many times, I thought "knew" something after reading from the course, I didn't really understand it completely until it was time to put the knowledge to the test in making the app. That's the real test! So I plan to continue to work on and create new apps that stretch my understanding because the work is only beginning!
