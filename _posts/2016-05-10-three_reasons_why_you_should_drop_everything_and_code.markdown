Why did I choose to learn web development? While it took me much of my life to figure out, web development represents everything I want from a career. To sum it up, a career in web development keeps you continually learning, gives you the skills to turn ideas into reality, and work with awesome people!

1. The Challenge of Constantly Learning

	Ever had a job where you're just waiting for the time to pass? Recent college grads know the pain of time inching by as you feel unchallenged, unmotivated, and unfulfilled. Enter software development. At it's core, programming is solving puzzles and building blocks. It offers the kind of challenge where you'll be pulling your hair out one minute and the next minute you're on top of the world. You challenge your creative brain to come up with solutions to puzzles and you're constantly learning. There's usually a better way to do something and the challenge of figuring that out is tempered with the incredible support you get from the community online. Since I've started, I've noticed my thinking become clearer and I'm better able to juggle complex thoughts. 

2. It's Empowering

	As I learn web development, the idea that I'll have the skills to turn my ideas into reality through code is an extremely exciting idea. Everyone has those "Wouldn't the world be better if..." ideas and as a software developer you can make those ideas a reality. In recent years, the internet has proven to be the world's greatest vehicle of social justice through providing education and awareness in areas of health, environment, and gender equality all over the world. It's empowering to know that you'll have the tools to create a new application that can empower others on the other side of the planet. Your skills and understanding of our modern technological world are in demand as other people seek your help to make their vision come to life.

3. Work with smart, friendly and talented people

	Learning software development means joining a community of idea people who seek to add value to the world. You're no longer on the sidelines marveling at how far the world's come when you read the news. You're right in the thick of it. And the programmers I've met so far in the Ruby community have been an incredible combination of friendly, smart, and humble. Complainers need not apply. As a programmer, you are a problem solver: self-reliant, and a self starter who rather figure out solutions to solve a problem rather than complain to a boss. You think in terms of efficiency and efficacy towards addressing everyday problems in life.
