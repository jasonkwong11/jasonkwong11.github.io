Experts predict that by the year 2020, the number of active users on the internet will grow from 3.14 billion to 5 billion. Amazon's Alexa signals a voice recognized platform that promises to be the next iPhone in terms of changing the way we live our lives. Want to learn Irish? Try Duolingo. Not sure which TV show to watch? Don't worry, Netflix's algorithm has that covered. Today, it's clear that more and more, that software is an increasingly big part of our lives. Here are my top three reasons why I think everyone should learn software development:

1. The Challenge

	Ever had a job where you're just waiting for the time to pass? Recent college grads know the pain of time inching by as you feel unchallenged, unmotivated, and unfulfilled. Enter software development. At it's core, programming is solving puzzles and building blocks. It offers the kind of challenge where you'll be pulling your hair out one minute and the next minute you're on top of the world. You challenge your creative brain to come up with solutions to puzzles and you're constantly learning. There's usually a better way to do something and the challenge of figuring that out is tempered with the incredible support you get from the community online.

2. It's Empowering

	As I learn web development, the idea that I'll have a chance to literally write the future of the world through code is an extremely exciting idea. Everyone has those "Wouldn't the world be better if..." ideas and as a software developer you can make those ideas a reality. In recent years, the internet has proven to be the world's greatest vehicle of social justice through providing education and awareness in areas of health, environment, and gender equality all over the world. It's empowering to know that you'll have the tools to create a new application that can empower others on the other side of the planet. You're skills and understanding of our modern technological world are in demand as other people seek your help to make their vision come to life.

3. Work with smart, friendly and talented people

	Learning software development means joining a community of idea people who seek to add value to the world. You're no longer on the sidelines marveling at how far the world's come when you read the news. You're right in the thick of it. And the programmers I've met so far in the Ruby community have been an incredible combination of friendly, smart, and humble. Complainers need not apply. As a programmer, you are a problem solver: self-reliant, and a self starter who rather figure out solutions to solve a problem rather than complain to a boss. You think in terms of efficiency and efficacy towards addressing everyday problems in life.
